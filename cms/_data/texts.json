  "-1713eb80": "A marketing consultant once said the website is the mother ship of all small businesses. Next to your website the most important piece of public information is the Google My Business page or “GMB”. GMB is the biggest directory listing on the web. It contains your name, phone number, address, hours, services and so much more. Optimizing this listing is how your business stands out to Google.",
  "-6c61238d": "The GMB or Google My Business page is also the map listing that everyone is so familiar with due to the rise of mobile devices. The algorithms that control what business sees the most traffic rewards optimized GMB pages. Google recognizes that this business hasn’t had a review in 6 months or has no pictures posted. A listing that doesn’t regularly post anything or has inconsistent information is not going to get as much organic traffic as a business that is continually working on their GMB.",
  "-2d57b47f": "If you type in “best insurance agent near me”-Who do you think Google is going to prioritize on your very limited space on the Google search results? The agent with 6 reviews and no activity in the last 9 months - or the agency with 35 reviews (and reviews being added weekly), 4 GMB posts in the last month, seasonal photos with their team, updated hours on national holidays and revised services and products in the last 90 days? ",
  "9c09c5": "The company that is utilizing their GMB will be rewarded with more organic traffic over the company that doesn’t bother with their GMB listing. Google might even think the inactive GMB is not a very popular or relevant choice for that Google user or maybe even guess they’re going out of business or closed down. ",
  "-554fe5ba": "Want to get “into the maps” and beat out your competition? Then it’s time to put consistent effort into your GMB and remind Google that your business is a relevant and popular choice for the members of your community. At the end of the day that’s all Google is trying to do-help people access useful information. ",
  "-6d29fc1f": "We’ll manage your GMB page and keep your inbound flowing in. Most importantly we’re taking this off your to do list and letting an experienced SEO team handle this critical yet tedious job."
